# About this project
This github project is a demo to help non-devs to get started executing their rivet graphs in node.js
As the official docs require us to run a TypeScript application this might prove a considerable challenge to any non-developer. So this project includes everything you need to be able to run it immediately in Visual Studio Code with a few simple steps.

## How to adjust the project to your own rivet graphs
- Add your own Rivet projects to the root folder of the project
- Edit "rivet.ts" in /src" folder and update "project" and "graph" variables
- Change inputs (can also be left empty = ```"inputs": {}```)
- Adjust output "result.response.value" accordingly to your graph outputs (if you have any)
